# About
This is a Discord bot that facilitates playing a small economy game where you can work for a fake currency, you can spend it to passively generate the currency, you can gamble it away and you can give it away to your friends or use it to try to steal their fake currency.

It currently has over 8 million transactions and 20,000 users. It has 1,000 active users and it runs on commodity hardware.

This project has been amazing in helping me learn poor Go architecture and I don't recommend you make the same mistakes I did here.

If you want to see more contemporary Go architecture please see this repo here: https://github.com/SophisticaSean/reddit-admin-bot
